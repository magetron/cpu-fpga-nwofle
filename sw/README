Run `make` to build useful toolkits for this project.

Read `./main.out -h` before proceeding with launching the CLI.

Usually, root privilege is required to access raw sockets, which is a must for the FPGA CLI interface.

Sample usage `sudo ./main.out -f enp8s0 -p`.

Other tools are also built with `make`, under the `tools/` folder. Namely a prototype pkt sender and receiver, an admin packet builder and an ethernet CRC32 checker.

Note, to enable promiscuous mode on NIC for FPGA testing, run `sudo ip link set [interface] promisc on`.
