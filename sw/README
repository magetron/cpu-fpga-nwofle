Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch `siphash-ref-impl`.

Prerequisites:
- GCC 10.0+
- libedit

Make sure the key in `sw/admin-cli/fpga-filter.hh` `admin_buf_key` is the same key used in hardware.

Run `make` to build useful toolkits for this project.

Read `./main.out -h` before proceeding with launching the CLI.

Usually, root privilege is required to access raw sockets, which is a must for the FPGA CLI interface.

Sample usage `sudo ./main.out -f enp8s0 -p`.

Other tools are also built with `make`, under the `tools/` folder. Namely a prototype pkt sender and receiver, an admin packet builder and an ethernet CRC32 checker.

Note, to enable promiscuous mode on NIC for FPGA testing, run `sudo ip link set [interface] promisc on`.
