\section{Project Context}
Networking applications are becoming increasingly demanding due to the huge increase in the amount of data generated nowadays. More and more, these applications require higher bandwidth and lower latency in order to archive better and more responsive service. Hence, it is becoming a challenge not to overload the CPU with a network stack running at maximum bandwidth \cite{chen-2018}. In other words, the CPU should be enabled to spend more of its resource dealing with actual data rather than running the network stacks.

DPU-based NICs (Data Processing Unit based Network Interface Cards) are designed to offload the traffic processing steps of the network stack from the CPU and the kernel \cite{mellanox}. Compared to simple NICs, DPU-based NIC goes beyond simple connectivity, and implements network traffic processing on the board. Namely, network offloading NICs can be divided into 3 types, ASIC-based, FPGA-based and SOC-based, each with their own trade-offs \cite{mellanox}. As shown in Figure \ref{nic-comparison} below, a ASIC-Based NIC provides the best performance out of all 3, but the development cost is also the most expensive and the extensibility is the worst out of all 3. On the other side of the spectrum, SOC-based NIC requires least development but the performance is incomparable with the other hardware-based solutions.

Therefore, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) has been proven to be a middle ground in this scenario. With their unique mix of configurable hardware logic, its NIC can deliver great network processing performance while keeping the development cost rather low. One can program a FPGA card simply by flashing a program on to the board, which is not possible compared to its ASIC counterparts \cite{4068926}.

Such that, the aim of the project is explore the possibility and usability of offloading lower layers of network connections to FPGAs. This includes building a offload engine that processes incoming network traffic on the board and exposing designed APIs for software to access processed application data.

\section{Project Overview}

In this project, the main goal is to build a offload engine that handles Ethernet frames coming in and out of the node. A Xilinx Spartan 3E Starter Kit with a RJ45 connector would be used to handle the traffic as an offload engine. Applications running on host computer connecting to the board via USB would be able to receive and send processed data through the network via the software interfaces provided on the board.
